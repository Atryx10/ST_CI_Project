# ST_CI_Project

This report outlines the development of Continuous Integration (CI) using six different types of tools or components to automatically run unit and integration tests. The CI environment enables automated tests to be performed accurately, resulting in good quality assurance.

Continuous Integration is a software development practice that involves continuously merging code changes into a central repository, and then automatically building, testing, and deploying the application. This practice helps to identify issues early in the development process, which leads to faster feedback and faster resolution of issues.
